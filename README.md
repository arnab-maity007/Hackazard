## 📌 Problem Statement

Problem statement 1: Weave AI magic with Groq

## 🎯 Objective
This problem statement asks you to design a simple digital platform that helps small and medium nonprofit organizations manage their fundraising activities, engage with their communities and volunteers, and maintain transparency in all their operations. The goal is to make it easy for nonprofit teams to use, even if they’re not very tech-savvy. Your solution should clearly show how money is raised and used, offer secure and verifiable tracking of donations, and include features that help attract and retain community involvement.
